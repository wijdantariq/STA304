      <description>My name is Wijdan Tariq. I am a mathematics and statistics student at the University of Toronto. I am creating a series of blog posts to share my analysis of social issues based on real-life data.
This website was made using the [blogdown] (https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.</description>
