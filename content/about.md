My name is Wijdan Tariq. I am a mathematics and statistics student at the University of Toronto. I am creating a series of blog posts to share my analysis of social issues based on real-life data.

This website was made using the [**blogdown**] (https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
